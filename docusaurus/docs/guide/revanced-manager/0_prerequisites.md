# 💼 Prerequisites

In order to use ReVanced Manager, certain requirements must be met.

## 🤝 Requirements

- An Android device running Android 8 or higher
- Any device architecture except ARMv7[^1]

[^1]: This constraint only applies to patches, that require patching APK resources which is why some patches may or may not work on ARMv7 architecture. You can find out, which architectures your device supports here: [⚙️ Configuring ReVanced Manager](2_usage/4_settings.md).
