# ðŸ§© Patching apps

The following pages will guide you through using ReVanced Manager to patch apps.

## ðŸªœ Steps to patch apps

1. Navigate to the **Patcher** tab from the bottom navigation bar
2. Tap on the **Select an app** card
3. Choose an app to patch[^1]
   > **Note**: The suggested version is visible in each app's card.
4. Tap on the **Select patches** card and select the patches you want to apply[^2]
   > **Warning**: If you see a warning you can click on it for more information.
5. Tap on the **Done** then **Patch** button
   > **Warning**: The patching process may take ~5 minutes. Exiting the app may increase the time it takes to patch.
6. Tap on the **Install** button
   > **Note**: If you are rooted, you can mount the patched app on top of the original app.[^3]
   > Optionally, you may export the patched app to storage using the options in the top right corner.

[^1]: Non-root users may be prompted to select an APK from storage, in which case you have to source the APK file yourself. ReVanced does not provide any APK files.
[^2]: It is suggested to use the default set of patches by tapping on the **Default** button above the list of patches.
[^3]: Mounting the patched app on top of the original app will only work if the installed app version matches the version of the app selected in step 3. above.
